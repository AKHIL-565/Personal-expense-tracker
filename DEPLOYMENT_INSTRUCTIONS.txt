IMPORTANT: Deployment Instructions

To make the app work on Vercel, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Vercel Project Settings > Environment Variables.
2. Add the following variable:
   - Key: MONGO_URI
   - Value: mongodb+srv://akhilname_db_user:akhil123@cluster0.qkjduxo.mongodb.net/expense_tracker?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

3. Redeploy your project (e.g., push a new commit or click Redeploy in Vercel).

The code has been updated to support Vercel Serverless Functions automatically via the `api/` directory and `vercel.json`. The backend will now run on the same domain as the frontend.
